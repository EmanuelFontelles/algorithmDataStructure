# percolation

Created by Eric Stansifer.

Hosted at `https://github.com/estansifer/percolation/`.

A program for finding sizes of clusters in a percolation process.

Use python to invoke the file `perc.py` from the commandline, for example:

    python perc.py

If no arguments are given, the program prints instructions for how to use it.

As a suggested starting point, try

    python perc.py ones 20 0.5

to make a 20x20 percolation grid where each site is occupied with probability 0.5.
